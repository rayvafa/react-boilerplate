# v1-boilerplate

Simple boilerplate for client side apps, as opposed to my [other boilerplate]](https://github.com/tomdaniels/boiler-plate) with Redux, Firebase DB, Auth intergration and testing suits. 

## Out of the box? 

- Webpack set up for local dev environment.
- Only requires to create React components and styling (all tooling taken care of).
- Has express server.js file for quick deployment once ready.
- Node server is set up through webpack already. 

### TODO: 

> Automate setup through command line. 
> Publish to npm..?
